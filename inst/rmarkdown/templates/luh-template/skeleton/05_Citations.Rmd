For in-text citations, simply use `@bib_key`, where the `bib_key` is the key of your reference in the bibliography (explained below).
For example, `@wickham_r_2016` will produce the following: @wickham_r_2016 is an outstanding introduction to data science with R.

To cite in parentheses, just wrap the bib-key in squared brackets `[@wickham_r_2016]`.
You can add multiple entries by separating them with a comma and also write text before and after the reference, for example `[see @wickham_r_2016, p. 109]`.[^3]
The following example illustrates this:

[^3]: Note that LaTeX citation, i.e. `\cite{}` and `\citep{}` are also fully supported.

A three factor model including a size and a value factor improves the explanatory power of the CAPM [see @fama_common_1993, p. 4.].

## Footnotes

Instead of citing in parentheses, we recommend citation in footnotes.
This is not mandatory, as long as you cite properly and include the pages.
To include a footnote, just write `^[Content of the footnote]` and add the citation without the parentheses in the footnote, e.g.: `^[See @fama_common_1993, p. 4.]`.
In your thesis, this should look as follows:

A three factor model including a size and a value factor improves the explanatory power of the CAPM.[^4]

[^4]: See @fama_common_1993, p. 4

## Generating a bib-file and bib-keys

In this example, the references are in the example file for the bibliography which come with the template.
Once you start working on your thesis, you have to add your own literature to the bibliography, this requires a certain syntax.
Instead of creating the bib-file manually, I recommend a reference manager.
The easiest options are Zotero and Jabref.
I recommend Zotero, because future RStudio releases will support Zotero directly (unfortunately, we're not there yet).

To organize your library in Zotero, you can drag and drop pdf files or add new entries with common indicators such as ISBN or DOI.
Once you gathered all the literature, just highlight the references, click right -\> Export Items to get to the following menu:

![Creating a Zotero bibliography.](FIGURES/Zotero.PNG){width="100%"}

Then select "BibTex" to save the .bib file in the folder BIB.
Just adapt the `bibliography: BIB/example_bibliography.bib` statement in the header to use your file and you're done.

One important drawback is that you have to use the key instead of the full title.
Zotero creates bib-keys in the following way:

1.  First author (last name)
2.  First word of the title
3.  Year of the reference.

Each element is separated with `_`.
Just look up `@fama_common_1993` in the bibliography below to see that.
For now, it is straightforward to have the bib-file open in a text editor and copy the entries manually.
A direct support in RStudio is on the way.
**Note: Make sure to maintain the references in Zotero (reference type, authors etc.) to export them correctly to the bib-file.**
