If your thesis needs an appendix, simply use `\appendix` to separate the main body of your thesis from the appendix.
The sections will have alphabetic enumeration instead of Arabic numbers to indicate appendices.
Ideally, use `\newpage` to start the appendix on a new page.

If you write as a group, one appendix should be dedicated to the contribution of each student.
Please edit the following table accordingly to highlight which student contributed to which section:

| Section | Student            |
|--------:|--------------------|
|       1 | Melissa Musterfrau |
|     2.1 | Maxi Musterperson  |
|     2.2 | Maxi Musterperson  |
|     3.1 | Max Mustermann     |
|     ... | ...                |

Hint: Use the tablesgenerator.com for this table.

Finally, please state whether you want a joint of individual evaluation of your thesis by altering the following sentence:

We decided for a joint evaluation of the thesis.
