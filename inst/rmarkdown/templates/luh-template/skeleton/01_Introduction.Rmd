This simplified RMarkdown template is designed for students at the Leibniz University Hannover (LUH) to prepare their (seminar) thesis. 
The cover sheet and the statutory declaration (ehrenwörtliche Erklärung) are in compliance with the requirements of the Student Dean's office. 
Margins, font size and citation style are in line with the formal guidelines of the Institute of Banking and Finance and may be adapted to the requirements at other LUH institutes. 


This document is structured as a main document (Thesis.Rmd) with several child documents which are the main chapters. To knit the document, always knit the master document Thesis.Rmd. The code chunks


"{r child='01_Introduction.Rmd'}"

will then tell RMarkdown to include the child document "01_Introduction.Rmd" in the **same** folder as the main document. 

This is optional, as you can easily write the chapters in the main document, but it helps separating chapters between group members. Note that the chapters will not compile individually!
