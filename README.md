# Leibniz University Hannover RMarkdown Template

This is a simplified thesis template in compliance with the formal guidelines of the School of Economics and Management at Leibniz University Hannover. 
The template was inspired by the [thesisdown package](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown), but is simplified in many dimensions. 
The template explains how to handle those adjustments.

## Installation

To install the thesis as a standalone R package, use

```
install.packages(rmarkdown)

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SebSchroen/leibnizdown")
```

To start a new draft, use RStudio and click File -> New Document -> RMarkdown and select "From Template" where you find this template. This procedure will create a new directory with all required files to compile the thesis.

## Prerequisites



### RStudio/ RMarkdown

Make sure to have the latest version of RStudio installed on your computer. 
The template will work with RStudio 1.3 upwards.
To make sure that all rmarkdown depencies are installed, install the package `rmarkdown` as follows:

```
install.packages(rmarkdown)

```


### LaTeX
Before using the template, make sure to have a working LaTeX installation on your computer. 
By far the easiest way is the R package `tinytex`:

```
install.packages(tinytex)

tinytex::install_tinytex()

```
This might take a while. 
Make sure to restart RStudio after installation. 

**Note: The first compiling of the document might take a couple of minutes because tinytex installs package depencies in the background.**



## Citation style

The folder CSL contains the citation style, the default is APA (American Psychological Association) as provided by [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/styles/). 
Other specific styles are available in the [official repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles#readme) for Citation Style Language citation styles.
To change the style, store the file in the designated folder and change the yaml header accordingly.
